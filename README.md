Introduction:
SecureMessageEncryptor is a Python program designed to help you encrypt your messages securely. Follow these simple steps to protect your messages from prying eyes:

Usage Instructions:

Run the main.py file with your Python interpreter.
Choose an encryption option from the menu that suits your needs.
Enter the message you want to encrypt when prompted.
The program will perform the encryption based on your chosen method.

Library (library.py):
The library.py file contains methods that handle the encryption process for each selected option and stores dictionaries required for the encryption.

Available Encryption Options:

ROT13: This option uses the ROT13 algorithm to shift characters in your message.
Numbers: Converts your message into a numerical code for added security.
ROT18: A variation of ROT13 and ROT5 for enhanced encryption.
ROT47: Provides stronger encryption using the ROT47 algorithm.

Future Updates:
We are committed to improving SecureMessageEncryptor. Expect more encryption options to be added in the future, ensuring the most robust message security.

To test the program follow these simple stes:

1- **Open the terminal of your operative system**

2- **Go to the folders path**

3- **Type <code>python3 main.py</code> or <code>python main.py</code>**

4- **Enjoy!**
