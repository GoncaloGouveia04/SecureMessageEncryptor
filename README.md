Introduction:
SecureMessageEncryptor is a Python program designed to help you encrypt your messages securely. Follow these simple steps to protect your messages from prying eyes:

Usage Instructions:

Run the main.py file with your Python interpreter.
Choose an encryption option from the menu that suits your needs.
Enter the message you want to encrypt when prompted.
The program will perform the encryption based on your chosen method.

Library (library.py):
The library.py file contains methods that handle the encryption process for each selected option and stores dictionaries required for the encryption.

Available Encryption Options:

ROT13: This option uses the ROT13 algorithm to shift characters in your message.
Numbers: Converts your message into a numerical code for added security.
ROT18: A variation of ROT13 and ROT5 for enhanced encryption.
ROT47: Provides stronger encryption using the ROT47 algorithm.

Future Updates:
We are committed to improving SecureMessageEncryptor. Expect more encryption options to be added in the future, ensuring the most robust message security.

To test the program, please follow these steps:

1. **Download the Files:**
   - If you haven't already, download the program files to your computer.

2. **Open a Terminal:**
   - On most operating systems (Windows, macOS, or Linux), open a terminal or command prompt.

3. **Navigate to the Program Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you downloaded the program. For example:
     ```
     cd path/to/program_directory
     ```

4. **Run the Program:**
   - To run the program, execute the following command:
     ```
     python3 main.py
     ```
   - If you are using Python on Windows, you can use the command:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
     If Python 3 is installed, this should work as well.

5. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions:**
   - The program will display a menu of encryption options. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose an option and provide input as needed.

6. **Enjoy Using the Program:**
   - Use the program to encrypt and decrypt messages using various algorithms. Have fun exploring its features!

Note: If you don't have Python 3 installed on your system, you may need to download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from your operating system's package manager. If you're using Windows, you can also follow the on-screen instructions to install Python 3 from the Microsoft Store.
